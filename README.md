# PU - prepBot
How to structure learning and effective lectures are on a daily basis creating trouble for both students and lecturers. We were given this information interviewing professors at NTNU. Looking at this problem, we saw a possibility to revolutionize each student’s learning experience, and the lecturer’s ability to follow his/her students progress. prepBot makes it possible to take automatically generated tests from earlier exams in a subject given to each student based on their level of knowledge. 

For the professors prepBot provides functionality for creating tests which will be given to students signing up for the class on their profile. The results from these, and other available test, will be shown to the professors so that they can adjust the lectures based on the student’s knowledge level. prepBot will be a website, easy and safe to use. Creating a profile and adding subjects will be effective, and therefore we will motivate students to use the program. Information about knowledge level is valuable, and we believe this will be a key to a solution who can revolutionize learning experiences across the world.
